# Task

Action recognition using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), (Long-Short Term Memory) LSTM in particular. The aim to build a neural network that can not only capture spatial information of each frame but also temporal information between frames. 

Experiments:

FEATURE EXTRACTION for Images

Evaluation (LSTM)

Evaluation (SVM)

## Results
Test Accuracy using custom LSTM model on this dataset is:  90.20422535211267
Test accuracy for SVM is  94.02112676056338

## Implementation
Leveraging pytorch utils the networks were designed and implemented to accomplish the task.
